# Files List
-   JEUS 8.0
-   Eclipse 4.23(possible(4.16)| Eclipse support for the most part up to 4.16 so I will recommend 4.16)
-   JEUS Eclips Plugin for JEUS8
-   JDK1.8u331

Eclipse don't support JEUS8.5 
Error Missing classpath entry 

if You have a lot of JDK in your Windows You should change the basic of JDK into 1.8 

Shell > java -version

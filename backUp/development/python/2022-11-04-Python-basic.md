# Using Python as a Calculator

Let's try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for primary prompt

# Numbers

The interpreter acts as a simple calculator : you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward:
the operators +,-,* and / work just like in most other languages 

```python
print(2 + 2)
print(50 - 5 * 6)
print((50 - 5 * 6) / 4)
```

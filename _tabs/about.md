Hi, my name is Kim jae Hyean. I'm from South Korea, and I have been working at WISEITECH for 5 years. My role is in technical support at WISEITECH. I have various experiences in infrastructure, developement, database, ETL, and more. What I find interesting is the development side, expecially the backend. I enjoy studying algorithms, acquiring new skills, and improving my English. This space serves as a record of my skills.
